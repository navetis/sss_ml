# Machine Learning in Heart Disease Prediction
## Analyzing the Influence of Small Sample Sizes
### Code

This is the code which has been used to run the experiments of the project *Machine Learning in Heart Disease Prediction - Analyzing the Influence of Small Sample Sizes* which was part of the *small sample sie* project seminar at HPI.

The following files are scripts belonging to the experiments

- *ml\_performance.py* is the script used to execute the first experiment of section \ref{sec:mlp_lows}.
- *overfitting\_test.py* is the script used to execute the second experiment of section \ref{sec:mlp_lows} which dealt with the overfitting. 
- *subgroups\_ml\_performance.py* is the script used to execute the first experiment of section \ref{sec:mlp_lows_subs}.
- *subgroups\_overfitting\_test.py* is the script used to execute the second experiment of section \ref{sec:mlp_lows_sub} which dealt with the overfitting. 
- *feature\_selection.py* is used to run the experiment from section \ref{sec:feature_selection}.

Please be aware, that the sampling of the data is a random process. Thus there is no guarantee that executing the scripts will yield identical results.
